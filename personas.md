Person 1:

* Who are you?: Computer Science Major 
* What's your main goal?: I want to graduate on time and minor in another subject.
* What's your main barrier to achieving this goal?: I am struggling with how to fit minor classes into a four year plan for computer science.

Person 2:

* Who are you?: Computer Science Major, Switched in from another Major
* What's your main goal?: I want to graduate on time.
* What's your main barrier to achieving this goal?: I am struggling with how to catch up with the computer science classes so I can graduate on time.

Person 3:

* Who are you?: Computer Science Major, Transferred in from another School
* What's your main goal?: I want to graduate on time.
* What's your main barrier to achieving this goal?: I am struggling with ensuring that I have completed the required degree courses in order to graduate.  Some transfer credits fulfilled requirements, while others did not, so I need to figure out what else I need to take to complete my degree.

Person 4:

* Who are you?: Computer Science Major, Another College of Engineering Major
* What's your main goal?: I want to graduate on time.
* What's your main barrier to achieving this goal?: I am struggling with ensuring that I can fit all courses for both of my majors in order to graduate.

Person 5:

* Who are you?: Non-Computer Science Major
* What's your main goal?: I want to minor in computer science.
* What's your main barrier to achieving this goal?: I am struggling with figuring out what computer science classes I can take, as many are restricted for majors only.

Person 6:

* Who are you?: Computer Science Major, Trying to Figure out Concentration
* What's your main goal?: I want to figure out what my concentration is by taking a variety of different computer science classes.
* What's your main barrier to achieving this goal?: I am struggling with figuring out how to fit these different courses into my schedule so I can determine my concentration and still graduate on time.  I am unsure how many "try-out" classes I can take before picking a concentration in order to graduate on time.
