We will examine a wide range of sources including periodicals, slave narratives, memoir/autobiography, oral history, poetry, visual art, film, and music, in addition to assigned secondary literature. In doing so, this course surveys the multitude of Black women\u2019s experiences and perspectives across class, region, and time. We will move both chronologically and thematically as we explore core themes such as labor, motherhood, sisterhood, sexuality, resistance, respectability, and political activism.

In this course we identify, examine, and explore dominant narratives about motherhood and reproduction from cross-cultural perspectives, and the personal stakes and political scales at which different experiences of motherhood impact. We focus specifically on motherhood since it is the relationship between mother and child that is predominantly politicized in various configurations of power both historically and contemporaneously, although we do examine topics related to parenthood more broadly. Through the study of ethnographic research, we look critically and cross-culturally at topics related to: contraception, family planning, fertility, pregnancy, birth, early childhood, motherhood, parenthood, child welfare interventions, media and popular cultural representations of motherhood, and labor and work, especially as these topics intersect with concerns related to nationhood, gender, sexuality, racism, class, socio-economic status, religion, politics, ethnicity, and cultural background.",

We look at the ritual significance of clothing and other practices of bodily adornment in traditional societies and the role of style in constituting contemporary social movements and identity categories. We investigate the globalization of the fashion industry, from design and production to branding and marketing, in order to understand the relationships among citizenship, consumption, labor, and power in the global economy. The course encourages students to reflect on their relationship to the wider society and economy as producers and consumers of material culture through the lens of clothing.",

Humanitarianism claims that all humans have the same right to care and protection, yet in reality human life continues to be unfairly stratified according to race, sexuality, gender, and ability: something that humanitarianism does not automatically solve. In this class, we dig deep into the ways that politics and social position frames humanitarian encounters, and we will particularly focus on the ways that people within groups who receive these interventions-particularly in continental Africa, or in situations of forced migration-themselves perceive and experience them. We go beyond the spectacle of celebrity humanitarianism, and consider instead the historical and cultural specificity of humanitarianism, and the politics of life and death.",

We approach law as a system of rules, obligations, and procedures. We also understand it as a cultural practice and moral regime. We ask: how are law, politics, and economics enmeshed and with what consequences? How does law provide tools for both social struggle and social control? How does anthropology contribute to our understanding of these issues? To answer these questions, we combine readings from classical legal anthropology with recent writings and other media produced by anthropologists, journalists, and activists working across the globe. This course is of particular interest to students concerned with law, policy, government, and related professions, as well as issues of social justice and diversity.",

The second half of the semester details the historical creation and oversight of policies related to federal agencies toward wildlife and wildlife habitat in the face of a growing and changing society. While the second half provides an overview of many policies, it also uses lengthier case studies to detail the interaction of human dimensions with wildlife conservation. Because wildlife and fisheries management in the 21st century has as much to do with human dimensions, economics and equity, social politics, and environmental policy, as it does ecology principles; this course is designed to prepare students to succeed as wildlife and natural resource professionals.",

Everywhere they existed, from Brazil to Jamaica, from Virginia to Suriname, or from Mexico to Haiti, they proved the indomitable spirit of African people and their descendants, and the great failures of the institution of slavery. Throughout the course, we will look closely at the demographic, economic, and geographic opportunities for enslaved mobility and resistance that shaped the formation of the Atlantic world. The central focus will be an analysis of the historical impact of marronage across the Americas from 1502 to 1865.",

Throughout this course, Black women\u2019s voices will be central. We will read Black women\u2019s writing, examine the ways Black women fashioned their own bodies, and we will survey Black women\u2019s art throughout this early period. We will examine a wide range of sources including periodicals, slave narratives, memoir/autobiography, oral history, poetry, visual art, film, and music, in addition to assigned secondary literature. In doing so, this course surveys the multitude of Black women\u2019s experiences and perspectives across class, region, and time. We will move both chronologically and thematically as we explore core themes such as labor, motherhood, sisterhood, sexuality, resistance, respectability, and political activism. A primary goal will be to consider how Black women have worked to determine their own lives and possess their own bodies while other groups have sought to dominate and control them.",

Closely related are recently trending topics including gender and sexuality studies, diversity, inclusive education, and how these and similar issues amalgamate in what we define as a relevant musical experience. The consideration of processes related to informal music learning will intersect with psychological and philosophical studies as such defines what humans consider to be a \u201cmeaningful musical experience\u201d with the express purpose of facilitating such experiences as performers, teachers, and advocates for musical artistry.",

Humanitarianism claims that all humans have the same right to care and protection, yet in reality human life continues to be unfairly stratified according to race, sexuality, gender, and ability: something that humanitarianism does not automatically solve. In this class, we dig deep into the ways that politics and social position frames humanitarian encounters, and we will particularly focus on the ways that people within groups who receive these interventions-particularly in continental Africa, or in situations of forced migration-themselves perceive and experience them. We go beyond the spectacle of celebrity humanitarianism, and consider instead the historical and cultural specificity of humanitarianism, and the politics of life and death.",

In doing so, this course surveys the multitude of Black women\u2019s experiences and perspectives across class, region, and time. We will move both chronologically and thematically as we explore core themes such as labor, motherhood, sisterhood, sexuality, resistance, respectability, and political activism.

In this course we identify, examine, and explore dominant narratives about motherhood and reproduction from cross-cultural perspectives, and the personal stakes and political scales at which different experiences of motherhood impact. We focus specifically on motherhood since it is the relationship between mother and child that is predominantly politicized in various configurations of power both historically and contemporaneously, although we do examine topics related to parenthood more broadly. Through the study of ethnographic research, we look critically and cross-culturally at topics related to: contraception, family planning, fertility, pregnancy, birth, early childhood, motherhood, parenthood, child welfare interventions, media and popular cultural representations of motherhood, and labor and work, especially as these topics intersect with concerns related to nationhood, gender, sexuality, racism, class, socio-economic status, religion, politics, ethnicity, and cultural background.",

Humanitarianism claims that all humans have the same right to care and protection, yet in reality human life continues to be unfairly stratified according to race, sexuality, gender, and ability: something that humanitarianism does not automatically solve. In this class, we dig deep into the ways that politics and social position frames humanitarian encounters, and we will particularly focus on the ways that people within groups who receive these interventions-particularly in continental Africa, or in situations of forced migration-themselves perceive and experience them. We go beyond the spectacle of celebrity humanitarianism, and consider instead the historical and cultural specificity of humanitarianism, and the politics of life and death.",
