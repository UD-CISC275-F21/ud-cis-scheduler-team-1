We will read Black women\u2019s writing, examine the ways Black women fashioned their own bodies, and we will survey Black women\u2019s art throughout this early period. We will examine a wide range of sources including periodicals, slave narratives, memoir/autobiography, oral history, poetry, visual art, film, and music, in addition to assigned secondary literature. In doing so, this course surveys the multitude of Black women\u2019s experiences and perspectives across class, region, and time. We will move both chronologically and thematically as we explore core themes such as labor, motherhood, sisterhood, sexuality, resistance, respectability, and political activism. A primary goal will be to consider how Black women have worked to determine their own lives and possess their own bodies while other groups have sought to dominate and control them.",

What can we learn from indigenous peoples, social movements, and intentional communities whose values and practices offer alternative visions for how to organize human-environment relations? This course draws on anthropological methods and research findings to examine diverse ways of defining \u201csustainability\u201d and living sustainably. We apply these findings to critically examine current debates and approaches to environmental issues, from the United Nations Climate Change accords to corporate sustainability platforms and environmental justice movements.",

In this course we identify, examine, and explore dominant narratives about motherhood and reproduction from cross-cultural perspectives, and the personal stakes and political scales at which different experiences of motherhood impact. We focus specifically on motherhood since it is the relationship between mother and child that is predominantly politicized in various configurations of power both historically and contemporaneously, although we do examine topics related to parenthood more broadly. Through the study of ethnographic research, we look critically and cross-culturally at topics related to: contraception, family planning, fertility, pregnancy, birth, early childhood, motherhood, parenthood, child welfare interventions, media and popular cultural representations of motherhood, and labor and work, especially as these topics intersect with concerns related to nationhood, gender, sexuality, racism, class, socio-economic status, religion, politics, ethnicity, and cultural background.",

Humanitarianism claims that all humans have the same right to care and protection, yet in reality human life continues to be unfairly stratified according to race, sexuality, gender, and ability: something that humanitarianism does not automatically solve. In this class, we dig deep into the ways that politics and social position frames humanitarian encounters, and we will particularly focus on the ways that people within groups who receive these interventions-particularly in continental Africa, or in situations of forced migration-themselves perceive and experience them. We go beyond the spectacle of celebrity humanitarianism, and consider instead the historical and cultural specificity of humanitarianism, and the politics of life and death.",

In this course, we study the cultural dimensions of law and human rights and examine law\u2019s changing relationship to state power, the global economy, social movements, and everyday life. We approach law as a system of rules, obligations, and procedures. We also understand it as a cultural practice and moral regime. We ask: how are law, politics, and economics enmeshed and with what consequences? How does law provide tools for both social struggle and social control? How does anthropology contribute to our understanding of these issues? To answer these questions, we combine readings from classical legal anthropology with recent writings and other media produced by anthropologists, journalists, and activists working across the globe. This course is of particular interest to students concerned with law, policy, government, and related professions, as well as issues of social justice and diversity.",

What is it that makes racism so intractable? This course works to answer that question by analyzing racism as a problem that\u2019s deeply embedded in Western societies, albeit similarly prevalent in many non-Western countries. We\u2019ll also look at how racism connects with other social categories such as Indigeneity, gender, sexuality, disability, religion and class. And in addition to considering how racism has operated to oppress, exclude and scapegoat, we\u2019ll also be attentive to how marginalized groups have fought back.",

Students also gain understanding and awareness of how to incorporate socio-demographic-economic value differences in addressing stakeholder concerns and wildlife policy development.  The second half of the semester details the historical creation and oversight of policies related to federal agencies toward wildlife and wildlife habitat in the face of a growing and changing society. While the second half provides an overview of many policies, it also uses lengthier case studies to detail the interaction of human dimensions with wildlife conservation. Because wildlife and fisheries management in the 21st century has as much to do with human dimensions, economics and equity, social politics, and environmental policy, as it does ecology principles; this course is designed to prepare students to succeed as wildlife and natural resource professionals.",

The second half of the semester details the historical creation and oversight of policies related to federal agencies toward wildlife and wildlife habitat in the face of a growing and changing society. While the second half provides an overview of many policies, it also uses lengthier case studies to detail the interaction of human dimensions with wildlife conservation. Because wildlife and fisheries management in the 21<sup>st</sup> century has as much to do with human dimensions, economics and equity, social politics, and environmental policy, as it does ecology principles; this course is designed to prepare students to succeed as wildlife and natural resource professionals.",

What is it that makes racism so intractable? This course works to answer that question by analyzing racism as a problem that\u2019s deeply embedded in Western societies, albeit similarly prevalent in many non-Western countries. We\u2019ll also look at how racism connects with other social categories such as Indigeneity, gender, sexuality, disability, religion and class. And in addition to considering how racism has operated to oppress, exclude and scapegoat, we\u2019ll also be attentive to how marginalized groups have fought back.",

Everywhere they existed, from Brazil to Jamaica, from Virginia to Suriname, or from Mexico to Haiti, they proved the indomitable spirit of African people and their descendants, and the great failures of the institution of slavery. Throughout the course, we will look closely at the demographic, economic, and geographic opportunities for enslaved mobility and resistance that shaped the formation of the Atlantic world.

We will read Black women\u2019s writing, examine the ways Black women fashioned their own bodies, and we will survey Black women\u2019s art throughout this early period. We will examine a wide range of sources including periodicals, slave narratives, memoir/autobiography, oral history, poetry, visual art, film, and music, in addition to assigned secondary literature. In doing so, this course surveys the multitude of Black women\u2019s experiences and perspectives across class, region, and time. We will move both chronologically and thematically as we explore core themes such as labor, motherhood, sisterhood, sexuality, resistance, respectability, and political activism. A primary goal will be to consider how Black women have worked to determine their own lives and possess their own bodies while other groups have sought to dominate and control them.",

In this class, we dig deep into the ways that politics and social position frames humanitarian encounters, and we will particularly focus on the ways that people within groups who receive these interventions-particularly in continental Africa, or in situations of forced migration-themselves perceive and experience them. We go beyond the spectacle of celebrity humanitarianism, and consider instead the historical and cultural specificity of humanitarianism, and the politics of life and death.",

Using both a theoretical and applied approach, we will analyze how historical and contemporary realities of women of color are influenced by a legacy of structural inequalities. The approach to this course will pay particular attention to sociological aspects of identity as well as cultural representations that are manifestations of systems of oppression. Finally, the course moves beyond intersectionality as \u201cidentity politics\u201d and examines the ways in which power is deployed through interlocking systems of oppression including white supremacy, patriarchy, and advanced capitalism.",

It will demonstrate to students how what have long been considered \u201cintimate\u201d social relations have become geographically dispersed, impersonal, mediated by and implicated in broader political-economic or capitalist processes. Students can systematically compare their lives as women and men with those of others around the world using social-science perspectives and increase their understanding of the gendered aspects of the dynamics of global cultural and economic interaction. Students will be able to apply theories of intersectionality and feminism as well as perform critical analyses of socioeconomic dimensions of gendered lives in local and global contexts.",

Throughout this course, Black women\u2019s voices will be central. We will read Black women\u2019s writing, examine the ways Black women fashioned their own bodies, and we will survey Black women\u2019s art throughout this early period. We will examine a wide range of sources including periodicals, slave narratives, memoir/autobiography, oral history, poetry, visual art, film, and music, in addition to assigned secondary literature. In doing so, this course surveys the multitude of Black women\u2019s experiences and perspectives across class, region, and time. We will move both chronologically and thematically as we explore core themes such as labor, motherhood, sisterhood, sexuality, resistance, respectability, and political activism. A primary goal will be to consider how Black women have worked to determine their own lives and possess their own bodies while other groups have sought to dominate and control them.",

In this course we identify, examine, and explore dominant narratives about motherhood and reproduction from cross-cultural perspectives, and the personal stakes and political scales at which different experiences of motherhood impact. We focus specifically on motherhood since it is the relationship between mother and child that is predominantly politicized in various configurations of power both historically and contemporaneously, although we do examine topics related to parenthood more broadly. Through the study of ethnographic research, we look critically and cross-culturally at topics related to: contraception, family planning, fertility, pregnancy, birth, early childhood, motherhood, parenthood, child welfare interventions, media and popular cultural representations of motherhood, and labor and work, especially as these topics intersect with concerns related to nationhood, gender, sexuality, racism, class, socio-economic status, religion, politics, ethnicity, and cultural background.",

Humanitarianism claims that all humans have the same right to care and protection, yet in reality human life continues to be unfairly stratified according to race, sexuality, gender, and ability: something that humanitarianism does not automatically solve. In this class, we dig deep into the ways that politics and social position frames humanitarian encounters, and we will particularly focus on the ways that people within groups who receive these interventions-particularly in continental Africa, or in situations of forced migration-themselves perceive and experience them. We go beyond the spectacle of celebrity humanitarianism, and consider instead the historical and cultural specificity of humanitarianism, and the politics of life and death.",
